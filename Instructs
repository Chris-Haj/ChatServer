select() check which sd is ready for reading or writing.
when checking read set, find main socket, (gets new sockets from other sockets) that exchange data with client.
when main socket is ready for reading, call accept. If other sockets are ready for reading, recv()/read().
Use queue for each connection. Queue will hold all msgs that must be written on connection.
when checking write set, if the sd is ready for writing, write once (not get blocked). Set socket to be non-blocking.

Message handling:
msg struct
